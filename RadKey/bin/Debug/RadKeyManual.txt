Usage:

1. Define names for the radicals in the radicalNames.txt file. Separate each name with a space, 
and make sure that you don't give the same name twice.

2. Open RadKey.exe. 

3. Type one of the radical names in the textbox labelled Radical Entry.

4. After typing in the full radical name, hit the Enter key. The name will be replaced with the radical.

5. Repeat this until all necessary radicals are entered.

6. Hit Enter to get a list of matching kanji. 

7. In the lower grid, use the arrow keys to highlight the kanji you want, and press Enter.

8. The selected kanji is copied into the Selected Kanji box.

9. Repeat as necessary. Ideally you want to look the selected kanji up in a full dictionary at this point.

Other features:

- You can enter a stroke count in the Strokes text box. This will cause only kanji matching the provided
stroke count to be returned.

- You can hit CTRL+J to toggle whether or not kanji without a frequency defined in KANJIDIC and a Jouyou grade of 9, 10, or undefined are displayed. They're hidden by default.

- You can hit CTRL+F to toggle whether kanji in the bottom grid are sorted by stroke, or by frequency.
